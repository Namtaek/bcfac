# bcfac


The repository is almost a copy of Yoo Young-hoon's work, who graduated from Sungkyunkwan University with a master's degree in statistics. There is a problem with compiling Rcpp in a local environment, so it is temporarily used in public mode.

## Installation

install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("Namtaek/bcfac")
```
